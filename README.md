# Editor Camera Position for Unreal Engine

This is a simple plugin for Unreal Engine that displays the camera position in the editor's viewport. It can also set and copy-paste the camera position.

## Why is it useful?

It is useful when you when you have a QA team that reports you a bug in specific location. Finding this place in the editor on a huge map with only coordinates is tricky. With this tool you can simply copy-paste this location and go directly to a place where the problem occurs. 

It is also useful if you want to share a specific world coordinates to a teammate without getting coordinates of a specific object.

## Does it work in UE5?

Yes it is! (Tested on UE5.3.1)
