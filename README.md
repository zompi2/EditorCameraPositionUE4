# Editor Camera Position for Unreal Engine

This is a simple plugin for Unreal Engine that displays the camera position in the editor's viewport. It can also set and copy-paste the camera position.

It works on UE4.27, UE5.2, UE5.3 and UE5.4 (or at least I tested it on these versions)

## Why is it useful?

It is useful when a QA team reports you a bug in specific location. Finding this place in the editor on a huge map with only coordinates is tricky. With this tool you can simply copy-paste this location and go directly to a place where the problem occurs. 

It is also useful if you want to share a specific world coordinates to a teammate without getting coordinates of a specific object.

## FAQ

**But you can save your fav camera positions using Ctrl+Numer**  
This plugin is not for saving your favourite camera positions. It's for a situation when you have to quickly jump to a specific coordinates, given to you by someone else (usually the QA).

**But you can just spawn cube, set it's location to the desired location, press F and delete that cube**  
Yeah... I know... but for me it was annoying to do it every time I needed that simple functionality. It saves you that few seconds every time :)
